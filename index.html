    <h1>About Independence day</h1>
    <p>The Independence Day of India, which is celebrated religiously throughout the Country on the 15th of August every year, holds tremendous ground in the list of national days,
       since it reminds every Indian about the dawn of a new beginning, the beginning of an era of deliverance from the clutches of British colonialism of more than 200 years. 
       It was on 15th August 1947 that India was declared independent from British colonialism, and the reins of control were handed over to the leaders of the Country.
        India's gaining of independence was a tryst with destiny, as the struggle for freedom was a long and tiresome one, witnessing the sacrifices of many freedom fighters,
         who laid down their lives on the line.

      <img src="Mahatma Gandi.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
      <p> (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi) was an Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, 
        and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country.
         Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.

        In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all 
        along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.
        ” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.

Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, one of the six children of Jhaverbhai Patel and Ladba, was born in Nadiad, Gujarat. There is no record of his date of birth. The generally accepted date, October 31, 1875, of which the source is his Matriculation certificate, was chosen by Vallabhbhai himself while filling in a form.

The family was an agriculturist one of the Lewa Patidar Community, and could in terms of economic status be described as lower middle-class. It was poor and had no tradition of education. <br>

Vallabhbhai’s childhood was spent away from books, in the ancestral fields at Karamsad. He was already in his late teens when he passed out from the Middle School at Karamsad and went to the High School at Nadiad, from where he matriculated in 1897.

Even as a young boy Vallabhbhai displayed qualities of organization and leadership that marked him out for his future role. Once as a sixth-form boy he organized a successful strike of his classmates that lasted for three days to teach a lesson to one of the teachers who was unduly fond of the rod.

Vallabhbhai must have inherited these attributes from his father who, it is said, had fought in the Mutiny under the Rani of Jhansi and was subsequently taken prisoner by Malhar Rao Holkar.

    <li id="LL">Lala lajapat Rai</li>
    <img src="Lala lajpat.jpg"  width="200px" height="200px">
    <p>Lajpat Rai was born on 28 January, 1865, in a Punjabi Hindu family, as a son of Urdu and Persian government School teacher Munshi Radha Krishan and his wife Gulab Devi, in Dhudike. Since childhood, he also had a desire to serve his country.

      In 1886, he moved to Hisar and started to practice law and became a founding member of the Bar council of Hisar along with Babu Churamani. He also founded the Hisar district branch of the Indian National Congress and reformist Arya Samaj. <br>
       To shape the political policy of India to gain independence, he also practiced journalism and was a regular contributor to several newspapers including The Tribune. In 1886, he helped Mahatma Hansraj establish the nationalistic Dayananda Anglo-Vedic School, Lahore. In 1914, he quit law practice to dedicate himself to the freedom of India. <br>
             
      He was elected President of the Indian National Congress in the Calcutta Special Session of 1920. In 1921, he founded Servants of the People Society, a non-profit welfare organization. He was of the view that Hindu society needed to fight its own battle with caste system, position of women and untouchability. Lala Lajpat Rai believed that everyone should be allowed to read and learn from the Vedas irrespective of one’s caste or gender.
      
      When the Simon Commission visited Lahore on 30 October, 1928, Lajpat Rai led a non-violent march in protest against it. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi (baton) charge the protesters and personally assaulted Rai. He did not fully recover from his injuries and died on 17 November, 1928.</p>
    <li id="KR">Kittur Rani Chennamma "</li>
    <img src="Chennamma.jpg"  width="200px" height="200px" >
    <p>The Kittur revolt of 1824, one of the earliest woman-led anti-colonial struggles. Rani Chennamma’s valour forms a significant part of Karnataka’s political imagination. The reason that Rani Chenamma came into our national consciousness after other women warriors like Rani Laxmi Bai was because Karnataka became a state much later.<br>
      A fleet of 20,000 British soldiers was positioned on the foothills of the Kittur fort as they attempted to invade the former princely state of Karnataka. But the Queen of Kittur, Rani Chennamma, retaliated and killed a British official to protect and safeguard her homeland. <br>
      Commemorating 200 years of Rani Chennamma’s rebellion against the British East India Company, several social groups across the country, including Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW), are organising a national campaign, Naanoo Rani Chennamma (I am Rani Chennamma too) on February 21. The campaign, which is set to begin from Kittur, the site of Chennamma’s resistance, calls on women to rise against patriarchal, anti-democratic and casteist forces in the country.

    <img src="Lakshmi bai.jpg"  width="200px" height="200px">
    <p>Rani Lakshmi Bai was the queen of the princely state of Jhansi, which is located on the northern side of India. She was one of the most leading personalities of the first war of India’s independence that started in 1857. In this article, we will present you with the biography of Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai, who was an epitome of bravery and courage. <br>
      She was born to a Maharashtrian family at Kashi (now Varanasi) in the year 19 November 1835. During her childhood, she was called by the name Manikarnika. Affectionately, her family members called her Manu. At a tender age of four, she lost her mother. As a result, the responsibility of raising her fell upon her father. While pursuing studies, she also took formal training in martial arts, which included horse riding, shooting and fencing. To know the complete life history of Jhansi ki Rani – Rani Lakshmi Bai, read on.

      In the year 1842, she got married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Raja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. On getting married, she was given the name Lakshmi Bai. Her wedding ceremony was held at the Ganesh temple, located in the old city of Jhansi. In the year 1851, she gave birth to a son. Unfortunately, the child did not survive more than four months.    </p>
    <li id="SN">Sarojini Naidu</li>
    <img src="Sarojini naidu.jpg"  width="200px" height="200px">
     <p>Sarojini Naidu was born in Hyderabad on 13 February, 1879. Her father, Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, was a Bengali Brahmin who was the principal of the Nizam’s College in Hyderabad. She was educated in Madras, London and Cambridge. Following her time in England, where she worked as a suffragist, she was drawn to Indian National Congress’ movement for India’s independence from British rule. <br>
      She became a part of the Indian nationalist movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj. She was arrested, along with other Congress leaders including Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Madan Mohan Malaviya for participating in 1930 Salt March. Sarojini was one of the major figures to have led the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement. She faced repeated arrestings by the British authorities during the time and even spent over 21 months (1year 9months) in jail. She was appointed the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925 and later became the Governor of the United Provinces in 1947, becoming the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the Dominion of India. <br>
      Her work as a poet earned her the sobriquet ‘the Nightingale of India’, or ‘Bharat Kokila’ by Mahatma Gandhi because of color, imagery and lyrical quality of her poetry. Naidu’s poetry includes both children’s poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism, romance, and tragedy. Published in 1912, ‘In the Bazaars of Hyderabad’ remains one of her most popular poems. <br>
      She died of a cardiac arrest on 2 March, 1949, at the Government House in Lucknow.
